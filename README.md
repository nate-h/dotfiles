# dotfiles
home dir config files like .bashrc, .vimrc, etc.


I've created this repository to share the same bashrc, vimrc, etc for all my machines.

To use, remove current .bashrc, .vimrc, etc  and create symlink to these repositories files (ln -s pathToFile pathToSymlink).

I will hopefully automate that ability.
